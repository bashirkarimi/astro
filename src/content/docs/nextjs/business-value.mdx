From a project/architecture/business vantage point, what tangible value does Next.js bring?

### Business / Stakeholder Value

- **Faster Time to Market**: Next.js gives a lot of built‑in capabilities (routing, SSR, SSG, image & font optimization) so you don’t need to assemble many pieces yourself. This reduces setup overhead and increases developer velocity. ([pagepro.co](https://pagepro.co/blog/what-is-nextjs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Improved SEO & Performance**: With server‑rendered HTML, static generation, and built‑in performance optimizations, you can deliver a better user‑experience, better Core Web Vitals, and improved search rankings. ([Leobit](https://leobit.com/blog/overview-of-next-js-for-modern-web-apps-pros-cons-and-use-cases/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Scalability & Global Performance**: With Edge runtimes, streaming, and caching strategies, Next.js is capable of supporting high traffic and distributed user bases. This matters for global businesses. ([Stack Five](https://www.stackfive.io/work/nextjs/10-practical-use-cases-for-next-js?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Unified Full‑stack Development**: Because Next.js includes frontend (React UI) + backend (API routes, server logic) + build/optimisation, you get a coherent stack. This simplifies hiring, tooling, and maintenance. ([pagepro.co](https://pagepro.co/blog/what-is-nextjs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Maintainability & Developer Experience**: File‑based routing, consistent conventions (`/app`, layouts, etc.), good TypeScript support, and strong community tooling increase code and team maintainability.

### Technical/Architectural Value

- **Hybrid Rendering Flexibility**: Sending static pages for some parts, SSR for others, CSR where necessary allows fine‑tuning performance vs UX.
- **Edge & Server Selection**: Ability to choose Edge runtime (for very low latency) vs Node server (for heavy compute) gives architectural flexibility.
- **Integrated Optimization**: Out‑of‑the‑box features (image optimisation, font loading strategies, streaming, code‑splitting) reduce “custom build config” work.
- **Modular Growth**: You can start simple (static site) and grow into full‑stack with Next.js features as your needs evolve.
