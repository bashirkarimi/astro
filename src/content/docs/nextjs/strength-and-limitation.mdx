### **Strengths:**

**Performance by Default**

- Automatic code splitting
- Image optimization
- Font optimization (next/font)
- Script loading strategies
- Streaming SSR

**Developer Experience**

- Zero-config TypeScript
- Fast Refresh (instant feedback)
- Built-in ESLint configuration
- File-based routing (no router config)
- API routes without separate backend

**SEO & Accessibility**

- Server-rendered HTML for crawlers
- Proper meta tag handling
- Semantic HTML from Server Components
- Works perfectly with your accessibility focus

**Scalability**

- Mix rendering strategies per route
- Edge runtime support (deploy globally)
- Incremental adoption (can use with existing React apps)
- Parallel rendering architecture

### **Limitations:**

- Hosting Constraints & Vendor Lock-In Considerations
- Learning Curve & Architectural Complexity
- Abstraction and Configuration Limits: Next.js simplifies many things, but for very unusual requirements (custom bundler tweaks, very specialized build config), it may feel restrictive.
- Bundle Size & Complexity in Large Apps: Because of its many features and abstractions, large Next.js apps may ship more JavaScript than leaner frameworks unless you optimize carefully. Some developers report performance issues under high load.
- State Management & Realtime / Complex Backend Logic Might Be Better Elsewhere
