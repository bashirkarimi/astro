Which projects are a good fit for Next.js — and which are less suited?

### Very Good Fit

- **Content‑heavy websites**: blogs, documentation, marketing/landing sites where SEO, speed matter.
- **Commerce & retail front‑ends**: especially when you need dynamic product pages + speed + global distribution.
- **Full‑stack web applications**: SaaS apps, admin panels, dashboards that benefit from unified full‑stack.
- **Projects with global scale or performance constraints**: multi‑region, mobile‑first, low‑latency needs.
- **Projects with React expertise**: teams already using React will ramp quickly into Next.js.

### Less Ideal Fit / Considerations

- **Ultra‑lightweight widgets or micro‑frontend islands**: If your need is extremely small (just a UI shell), a lighter library may suffice (e.g., plain React or Preact).
- **Non‑React stacks**: If your team is using Vue/Svelte/etc., then Next.js introduces tech mismatch.
- **Scenarios where bundle size/hydration cost must be absolutely minimal**: Some ultra‑lean frameworks (Astro, SvelteKit) may have an edge in ultra‑tight performance budgets.
- **Very custom build toolchains / legacy tech constraints**: While Next.js is flexible, in some highly custom build environments you may encounter friction.
