## Hello World

This is my blog post written in**Markdown**.

```

It has two parts:

1. **Frontmatter (YAML)**
    - Structured data (like JSON, but more readable)
    - Used for metadata (title, date, tags, SEO, etc.)
2. **Markdown content**
    - Human-readable content
    - Converted to HTML at build time

Astro turns this into:

- A **page** (or data source)
- With **typed metadata**
- And **compiled HTML** at build time

## Why Astro uses Markdown so heavily

Astro is designed for **content-driven sites**:

- Blogs
- Documentation
- Marketing pages
- Portfolios
- Landing pages

Markdown aligns perfectly with Astro’s core philosophy:

> Ship less JavaScript. Render at build time.
> 

## Why use Markdown instead of JSON?

**Markdown is for `content`, JSON is for `data`**

| Markdown | JSON |
| --- | --- |
| Written by humans | Written for machines |
| Supports rich text | No formatting |
| Readable in GitHub | Hard to read |
| Supports headings, links, code | Needs rendering logic |

## Markdown vs Headless CMS (Sanity, Contentful)

### High-level positioning

| Aspect | Markdown (.md / .mdx) | Headless CMS (Sanity / Contentful) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary audience | Developers | Non-technical editors |
| Content location | Git repo | External service |
| Update model | Git commit → deploy | Live publishing |
| Build model | Build-time | Build-time or runtime |
| Infra cost | Free | Paid (at scale) |
| Complexity | Very low | Medium → high |
| SEO | Excellent | Excellent |
| Best for | Blogs, docs, marketing | Editorial, product content |

**Rule of thumb**
