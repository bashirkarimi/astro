- **Islands Architecture (partial hydration):** Astro renders pages to static HTML and hydrates only small interactive components (“islands”) on the client. This reduces JS shipped and improves TTFB / First Contentful Paint.
- **Framework-agnostic components:** You can import React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Preact components inside `.astro` pages and hydrate them individually.
- **SSR + SSG + ISR-like behaviours:** Supports static site generation (SSG) by default, plus server rendering if you configure an adapter (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.). There are also patterns for incremental/static regeneration with hosting-specific adapters.
- **Zero/Minimal client JS by default:** If you don’t opt-in to hydration, components stay static — no runtime JS.
- **Built-in content features:** Good markdown/content pipeline; `.md`/`.mdx` support, collections, easy content-driven pages (great for blogs, docs).
- **Simple routing:** File-based routing with straightforward conventions.
- **Integrated image & asset handling:** Built-in optimizations (depends on version and adapters) and ability to use external image services.
- **Fast builds & Dev UX:** Quick dev server, HMR, and simple project bootstrap.
- **Extensible via integrations:** Adapters and integrations for CSS frameworks, CMS, analytics, and deployment targets.

```jsx
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';
---
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <!-- Renders static markup; hydrates the Counter only on client -->
    <Counter client:load />
  </body>
</html>
```

## **Astro by itself**

Astro’s `.astro` components are **HTML-first**. They handle:

- Layouts
- Static content (text, images, markdown)
- Simple interactivity (like links or anchors)

✅ These render to static HTML at build time and need **zero JavaScript** on the client.

## **When a framework is needed**

You bring in React, Vue, Svelte, etc., when you need **client-side interactivity** beyond what Astro can do natively.

Typical cases:

1. **Dynamic, stateful UI components**
    - Example: a counter, a form with live validation, a shopping cart mini-widget.
    - Astro alone can’t manage dynamic state on the client — a JS framework handles that.
2. **Complex interactivity or animations**
    - Example: drag-and-drop interfaces, interactive charts, sliders, carousels.
    - You need a reactive framework to track state changes efficiently.
3. **Reuse existing component libraries**
    - Example: Material-UI React components or Vuetify for Vue.
    - If you already have a library or want an ecosystem of prebuilt interactive components, you import the framework.
4. **Framework-specific ecosystem or integrations**
    - Some plugins, hooks, or integrations only exist in a framework (like a React hook for auth or a Vue composable for maps).

## **How Astro integrates frameworks**

Astro uses **“partial hydration” / islands architecture**: 

- You import the interactive component in your `.astro` page.
- You specify a hydration directive on how/when it should run on the client:

```
---
import Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';
---
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<Counter client:load />  <!-- React hydrates this only on the client -->
```

**Hydration directives**:

| Directive | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `client:load` | Hydrate as soon as JS loads |
| `client:idle` | Hydrate when browser is idle |
| `client:visible` | Hydrate when component scrolls into view |
| `client:media="(min-width: 768px)"` | Hydrate based on media query |

This ensures **minimum JavaScript** is shipped; only the interactive islands load JS.

## **Rule of thumb**

- **No framework needed:** Static content, simple interactions, text, images, markdown.
- **Framework needed:** Stateful, interactive, or library‑dependent components (dynamic UI, real‑time updates, heavy client logic).
